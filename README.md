# **Steve** - A Discord Bot

**Steve**, also called *Sterv* or *Sterv boot* as a joke, is a multi-purpose Discord bot still in development. He takes inspiration from bots like Tatsumaki, and was mostly created as an experiment/something to work on.

This repository serves as a backup for old code, but will be overwritten as soon as the rewrite, [herobrine](https://github.com/greysdawn/herobrine),s is finished.

**Official "birthdate":** 25 September 2017 (the day he started testing in larger servers)
